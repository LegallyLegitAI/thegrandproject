            <p>As a lawyer with over a decade of experience in corporate and commercial law, I've seen firsthand how small businesses and startups struggle with legal compliance. They often face a difficult choice: spend thousands on legal fees they can't afford, or "wing it" and hope for the best, exposing themselves to massive risks.</p>
            <p>I founded Legally Legit AI to bridge this gap. My mission is to democratize access to legal protection by combining my legal expertise with the power of artificial intelligence. We provide smart, affordable, and easy-to-use tools that empower business owners to understand their risks, generate the documents they need, and stay on top of their obligations.</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: 'var(--primary-blue)' }}>We're not here to replace lawyersâ€”we're here to make them more accessible and effective. By handling the foundational work, we help you go to your lawyer with better questions, saving you time and money.</p>
            <p>Thank you for trusting us to be your intelligent legal shield.</p>
